This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Static export

This project is configured to export as a fully static site.

- Build the static site to `out/`: `npm run build` (or `npm run export`)
- Serve the exported site locally: `npm run start`

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repo is set up to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

1. In GitHub, go to **Settings → Pages**
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
3. Push to `main` and the workflow will publish the site

Notes:

- If this is a project site (e.g. `username.github.io/<repo>`), the config automatically sets the correct base path during the GitHub Actions build.
